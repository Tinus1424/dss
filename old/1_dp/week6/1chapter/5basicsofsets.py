# a set is a collection of unique elements that can only
# be accessed by a for loop or in operator

# elements are either part or not part of a set

# sets can only contain immutable data types

# sets are created by set(), or {} without : like in dicts

# if you pass a string to a set you get unique characters

# len() gives number of elements in a set

# sets are strictly unordered in comparison to dicts

# dicts follow insertion order
