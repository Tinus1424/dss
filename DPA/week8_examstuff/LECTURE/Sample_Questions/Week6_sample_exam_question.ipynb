    "For her thesis project, Beth evaluated 5 models on 4 prediction tasks and saved the results (F1 scores that vary between 0 and 1) in four npy files named task1_results.npy through task4_results.npy. The model names go from \"A\" to \"E\" and are saved in that order within each file.\n",

The arrangement of the four tasks in these panels should be:\n",

    "The y range should extend from 0 to 1 and the y values should be the F1 scores from the appropriate file. The y-axis should have an axis label on the figure panels for tasks 1 and 3.\n",
